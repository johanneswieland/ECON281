	\begin{itemize}
		\item Simple theoretical models.
		\item Quantitative models.
		\item Cross-sectional identification.
		\item Time-series identification.
	\end{itemize}
	\item Why? Identification problems massive:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Fed lowers interest rates in 2008. What do we learn about effects of monetary policy?
		\item[$\Rightarrow$] Attack problem from many different angles.
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle[alignment=center]{Paper draft}
\begin{itemize}
	\item The paper should contain two parts:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item A new micro data fact or causal effect.
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Ok to build on (but not copy!) other work.
		\end{itemize}
		\item A (simple) macro model that connects the micro data fact to macroeconomic outcomes.
		\begin{itemize}
%			\item Simple models $>$ complicated models.
			\item Should have computational component (unless waived).

\section{Research Advice}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}
\frametitle[alignment=center]{Seminars, Lunches, etc}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Attending seminar and lunch is an important part of your PhD.
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Allows you to see cutting edge research, help improve peer's research, become part of research community.
		\item See how the sausage is made.
		\item In grad school I learned a lot from others' questions.
		\item Even if the topic is outside your immediate research area there are large spillovers from learning about techniques, data, and presentational skills.
	\end{itemize}
	\item Great line-up of external speakers this quarter:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Atif Mian, Sanjay Singh, Janice Eberly, John Mondragon, Diego Perez, Ricardo Reis, Kim Ruhl, Cecile Gaubert, Amy Handlan, Nick Bloom.
	\end{itemize}
	\item If macro is a secondary field, fine to only attend seminar and lunch for your primary field. But should attend something!
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}
\frametitle[alignment=center]{Research Advice}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Becoming a researcher is hard.
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Requires learning by doing. Only so much one can explain.
	\end{itemize}
	\item \emph{Persistence} is key.
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \emph{Every} paper hits a roadblock that initially appears fatal.
		\item \emph{Every} idea is related to something else and has a moment where someone says ''that sounds like [insert citation here].''
		\item \emph{Every} researcher has days (or weeks or months) where they
work extremely hard and have nothing to show for it.
	\end{itemize}
	\item The key is being able to wake up and work just as hard and be just as dogged on the 10th day (or 30th or 100th) as you were on the first.
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Work on something you love that motivates you.
		\item Every paper has boring parts or frustrating parts. Learn to love
the challenge.
		\item Use habit formation to your advantage.
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}
\frametitle[alignment=center]{Working Together}
\begin{itemize}
	\item I personally love to work with others.
	\begin{itemize}
		\item More fun.
		\item Fewer dead ends, less of an echo chamber.
		\item Motivate each other, give each other deadlines.
	\end{itemize}
	\item Talk to each other. Co-author if you come up with an interesting idea.
	\item You will learn as much from your peers as from the faculty
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Get to know each other! It's hard because of COVID, but it's crucial!
		\item Help each other with research. Workshop ideas. Talk economics. Have fun together.
		\item My PhD classmates are some of my best friends.
		\item I continue to learn from them long after I was done with the PhD.
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle[alignment=center]{How To Come Up With Ideas}
\begin{itemize}
	\item I personally love to work with others.

\section{Econometrics Review}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%



\begin{frame}
\frametitle[alignment=center]{Key Concepts\footnote{This material draws on Pat Kline's Econ 244 notes.}}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Data Generating Process
	\item Identification
	\item Causal Effect / Treatment Effect
	\item Moment
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle[alignment=center]{Data Generating Process}
\begin{itemize}
	\item A \emph{data generating process} (DGP) is a complete specification of the stochastic process generating the observed data.
	\item Equivalently, a specification of the probability $P_{\theta}(\bm{y})$ of observing any possible vector valued realization of the data $\bm{Y}$.
	\item Example: A DGP for $(Y_i,X_i)$ is
	\begin{align*}
		Y_i &= X_i + \epsilon_i \\
		(X_i, \epsilon_i) &\sim N(0,I_2) 
	\end{align*}
	\item In general a DGP is something you should be able to program in your computer and draw a sample from.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle[alignment=center]{Data Generating Process}
\begin{itemize}
	\item The DGP is assumed to belong to some family $\mathcal{F}$.
	\item A set of restrictions indexing a particular DGP in $\mathcal{F}$ is called a \emph{structure} $\mathcal{S}$.
	\item A \emph{model} $\mathcal{M}$ is a family of possible structures.
	\item Example of a \emph{model}:
	\begin{align*}
		Y_i &= \beta_0 + \beta_1 X_i + \epsilon_i \\
		(X_i, \epsilon_i) &\sim N\left(\begin{matrix} \mu_1 \\ mu_2 \end{matrix} ,\begin{matrix} \sigma_1^2 & \sigma_{12}^2 \\ \sigma_{12}^2 & \sigma_2^2 \end{matrix} \right) \\
		\bm{\theta} &= (\beta_0,\beta_1,\mu_1,\mu_2,\sigma_1^2,,\sigma_2^2, ,\sigma_{12})
	\end{align*}
	\item Example of a \emph{structure}: $\bm{\theta} = (0,0,0,0,1,1,0)$
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}
\frametitle[alignment=center]{Identification}
\begin{itemize}
	\item What is it?
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle[alignment=center]{Identification}
\begin{itemize}
	\item The problem of determining the structure from the joint distribution of the data in the population.
	\item Population $\Rightarrow$ What is knowable in infinite datasets.
	\item Tells us whether it is worth constructing estimators for use in real datasets.
	\item Two structures $\bm{\theta}'$ and $\bm{\theta}''$ are \emph{observationally equivalent} if $P_{\bm{\theta}'}(\bm{y})=P_{\bm{\theta}''}(\bm{y})$.
	\item The structure $\bm{\theta}'$ is \emph{globally point identified} if there is no other $\bm{\theta}$ in the model space with which it is observationally equivalent.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle[alignment=center]{Examples}
\begin{align*}
	Y_i &\sim N(\mu, \sigma^2) \\
	\bm{\theta} &= (\mu,\sigma^2)
\end{align*}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Is $\bm{\theta}$ identified? How?
\end{itemize}
\begin{align*}
		Y_i &= \beta_1 X_i + \epsilon_i \\
		(X_i, \epsilon_i) &\sim N\left(\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix} ,\begin{pmatrix} \sigma_1^2 & 0 \\ 0 & \sigma_2^2 \end{pmatrix} \right) \\
		\bm{\theta} &= (\beta_1,\sigma_1^2,\sigma_2^2)
	\end{align*}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Is $\bm{\theta}$ identified? How?
	\item Neoclassical growth model. Identified? How?
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle[alignment=center]{Language}
\begin{itemize}
	\item In econometrics you can either identify the structure $\bm{\theta}$  (think parameters) in the model $\mathcal{M}$ or you cannot.
	\item ``Identifying assumptions'' are restrictions on the model $\mathcal{M}$ (family of DGPs) such that $\bm{\theta}$ is identified.
	\item Don't run a regression if you can't describe the model $\mathcal{M}$ under which the parameter(s) of interest are identified.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}




%\begin{frame}
%\frametitle[alignment=center]{Example}
%\begin{align*}
%		Y_i &= \beta_1 X_i + \epsilon_i \\
%		(X_i, \epsilon_i) &\sim N\left(\begin{matrix} 0 \\ 0 \end{matrix} ,\begin{matrix} \sigma_1^2 & \sigma_{12}^2 \\ \sigma_{12}^2 & \sigma_2^2 \end{matrix} \right) \\
%		\bf{\theta} &= (\beta_1,\sigma_1^2,\sigma_2^2,\sigma_{12})
%	\end{align*}
%\begin{itemize}
%	\item Is $\bf{\theta}$ identified?
%\end{itemize}
%\end{frame}

%\begin{frame}
%\frametitle[alignment=center]{Causality}
%\begin{itemize}
%	\item Identification by itself has nothing to do with causality. 
%	\begin{itemize}
%		\item See first identification example.
%	\end{itemize}
%	
%\end{itemize}
%\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle[alignment=center]{Causality}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Identification by itself has nothing to do with causality. 
%	\begin{itemize}
%		\item See first identification example.
%	\end{itemize}
	\item Structural models postulate functional relationships for how endogenous variables are generated from exogenous variables. E.g.:
%	\item  (both observed and unobserved).
%	\item %Example:
	\begin{align*}
		Y_i &= f(S_i,X_i,U_i) \\
		(s,x,u) &\in \Omega_s \times \Omega_x \times \Omega_u \\
	\end{align*}
	with $(Y,S,X)$ observed and $U$ unobserved.
	\item If $S$ can be varied independently of $X$ and $U$, then the model implies a set of \emph{counterfactual} values that the outcome $y=f(s,x,u)$ would take under various values of the treatment $s$.
	\item The \emph{causal effect} or \emph{treatment effect} of changing $s$ from $s'$ to $s''$ is
	\begin{align*}
		\Delta_i = f(s'',x_i,u_i) - f(s',x_i,u_i)
	\end{align*}
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle[alignment=center]{Potential Outcomes}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Microeconomists will often use potential outcome notation for specifying causal questions. 
	\item An advantage of this framework is that it forces the researcher to be very explicit about the counterfactual.
	\item $D_i\in[0,1]$ is the treatment indicator.
	\item $Y_i$ is the observed data, $Y_i^0$ the outcome under treatment $D_i=0$, and $Y_i^1$ the outcome under treatment $D_i=1$,
	\begin{align*}
		Y_i = D_i Y_i^1 + (1-D_i) Y_i^0
	\end{align*}
	\item The causal / treatment effect is
	\begin{align*}
		\Delta_i = Y_i^1 - Y_i^0
	\end{align*}
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}
\frametitle[alignment=center]{Average Treatment Effect}
\begin{itemize}
	\item We are often interested in the \emph{average treatment effect} (ATE), $E(\Delta_i)$.
	\item If treatment is independent of potential outcomes,
	\begin{align*}
		D_i \bot (Y_i^1, Y_i^0)
	\end{align*}
	then a simple difference in means uncovers the ATE:
	\begin{align*}
		E(Y_i^1 | D_i=1 ) - E(Y_i^0 | D_i=0 ) &= E(Y_i^1  ) - E(Y_i^0) \\
		 &= E(Y_i^1  - Y_i^0) \\
		 &= E(\Delta_i) 
	\end{align*}
	\item Independence is an identifying assumption. This condition is sometimes called ``unconfoundedness.''
%	\item But what is the model $\mathcal{M}$ and what structure $\mathcal{S}$ are we identifying?
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle[alignment=center]{Conditional Independence}
\begin{itemize}
	\item It is rare in (macro-)economics that the independence assumption is reasonable. 
	\item Most of empirical we will see in this class will assume
		\begin{align*}
		D_i \bot (Y_i^1, Y_i^0 | X_i)
	\end{align*}
	\item $X$ could be a set of controls, in which case this will be termed ``conditional independence assumption'' or ``selection on observables''.
	\item $X$ could also be an instrument that is correlated with the treatment.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle[alignment=center]{Potential Outcomes and Structural Models}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Any model of potential outcomes can be written as a degenerate structural model and any structural model implies a set of potential outcomes.
	\item Example: $Y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_{i1} D_i + \epsilon_i$, $E(\beta_{i1})=\mu$ implies potential outcomes
	\begin{align*}
		Y_i^0 &= \beta_0 + \epsilon_i \\
		Y_i^1 &= \beta_0 + \beta_{i1} + \epsilon_i 
	\end{align*}
	\item Independence implies $E(\epsilon_i | D_i)=0$. This is a restriction on the model. The parameter (structure) we are identifying is $\mu$.
	\item Key result: Under (conditional) independence, a difference in (conditional) means will identify the ATE regardless of the underlying DGP.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}
\frametitle[alignment=center]{Moments}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Identification and causality are population-level concepts.
	\item A \emph{moment} is a statistic of the data, either in population or in a finite sample. 
	\item Examples:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item $E(Y_i^1 | D_i=1 ) - E(Y_i^0 | D_i=0 )$.
		\item Every estimator is a moment.
	\end{itemize}
	\item Causal effects or parameters are equal to population moments under suitable identifying assumption.
	\item But not vice versa.
%	\item But, as we see next, often informative about causal effects or parameters.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

%\begin{frame}
%\frametitle[alignment=center]{Estimator}
%\begin{itemize}
%	\item An estimator is a function of the data.
%	\item Every estimator is a moment.
%\end{itemize}
%\end{frame}

	\begin{enumerate}
	\item Git
	\item Make
	\item Tasks
